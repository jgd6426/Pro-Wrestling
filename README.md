# Pro-Wrestling (Coding Assessment)

### How to Use:
Go to the website [here](https://jgd6426.github.io/Pro-Wrestling/) or in the About section, 
upload a JSON file of your array of wrestler objects, and hit the "Start Tournament!" button.

Wrestler names will be displayed in the bracket, their opponent, who advances to the next match, and the tournament winner.

Hover over the "..." button on each match card to see more details about the rounds, wrestler health status, and moves performed.

All tournament details are also logged in the console similar to the sample output in the instructions.

If you don't have your own array, you can use the wrestlerArray.json file in this project to test it out.
